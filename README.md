# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was written as part of the prework for the Rutgers University coding bootcamp. It was used as a intro to learning basic HTML, CSS, Git/Git workflows and Javascript.
I built this project because it gave me an intro to working with HTML, CSS and Javascript and also a refresher on Git and its workflows.
I learned how to create a basic HTML layout with some simple CSS styling and to make some basic interactions using Javascript.

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide Webpage, refer to the notes in the section of interest and for suggestions on what to study, open the Console using F12. Once the console is open,
you should see a list of the topics we studied as well as a suggestion on what topic to study.
